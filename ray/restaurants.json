	'Manpuku Japanese Eatery':['A small udon place run by Japanese folks with affordable pricing. It can get a little busy around lunch time and you might have to wait 5-10 minutes to be seated as the venue is fairly small. I've only tried kake udon, ice mochi and takoyaki but my friends have tried niku udon, curry udon, and ochazuke and they have all been pretty good. Personally, I think they have the best takoyaki in Toronto, although it does take them a while to make it.The price range is generally under $10 if you're only getting one dish and it can feel pretty filling because of all the soup, but I think you might get hungry a little faster than if you were to, say, have some kind of meat dish.',10,

'Definitely a solid 4 stars and somewhere that I would definitely come back if in the area for a quick bite.It's nothing fancy, but you will definitely gets your money's worth! Place is inside the Grange mall (which isn't exactly the nicest) and definitely catering to the students in the area. Plenty of seating but they also do takeout. There's a standard menu with things ranging from donburi rice bowls, udon, and random snacks like takoyaki (octopus dough balls) and fried tofu ranging in price from $4 to $10, more for the fancier bowls. HIGHLY recommend the minced pork donburi! The niku udon was just ok. I personally would've skipped it. Rice dish was awesome. Overall quality and portion size was pretty good for the price you pay.Beer is also $5 for a bottle. Not bad! Cheers',10]
